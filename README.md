# Robocopy Tools (Batch Scripts)

Two Windows batch scripts to **safely move or copy folders** using Robocopy.  
- This script preserves the folder name, shows live progress, and creates logs.
- Good script for moving folders and files from a hard disk with bad sectors or freezing issues

## ‚úÖ Scripts
- **RobocopyMove.bat** ‚Üí moves a folder (deletes source after success)  
- **RobocopyCopy.bat** ‚Üí copies a folder (keeps source intact)  

---

## üîß Usage
1. Download the `.bat` file you want (Move or Copy).
2. Double-click to run.
3. Enter the **full source folder path** (example: `D:\Software\Fonts`).
4. Enter the **destination folder path** (example: `C:\Users\Haider\Downloads\Work Folder`).
5. The script will:
   - Create `Fonts` inside `Work Folder`
   - Copy or move all files/folders
   - Show live progress
   - Save a log file in the destination folder

## üìå Example
- Source: D:\Software\Fonts
- Destination: C:\Users\Haider\Downloads\Work Folder

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Files that cannot be read (bad sectors, corruption) will be skipped and logged.
- The script **moves files** (they are deleted from the source after successful copy).
- If you want to **keep originals**, replace `/MOVE` with `/COPYALL`.
